# Practice-Problems

Here are codes from various problems I've recently worked on. Some have been provided from uni courses, some from leetcode and others are examples from interview questions.

# calculatechange.c 
This program (written in C) asks you for an amount of money in cents, and returns how that change would be returned in coins.

# grapher.c

# maxprofit.c
This one is a leetcode problem called "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II. The instructions are as follows: "Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again)."

My submission passed 200 out of 200 test cases, had a runtime of 8 ms and used 6.4 MB of memory. 

# subsequentsum.c
This is a problem from an interview question. The task was to, given an integer n, find how many ways it would be possible to add up two or more subsequent natural numbers leading up to that integer n, which sum up to n. return the number of ways possible.
Ex: n=5 would return 1 as there is one way (2+3, 1+4 are not subsequent numbers). 

# validpar.c
Another leetcode problem! The instructions are:
"Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid."

My submission passed 76 out of 76 test cases, had a runtime of 0 ms and used 5.3 MB of memory. The runtime beat 100% of submissions.
